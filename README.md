## Something like Mineflayer for Bedrock

A *very* experimental implementation for creating bedrock bots. Mostly for personal use, testing ideas, and learning about bedrock internals, learning some Nodejs. I'm just throwing this out there for possible inspiration.

Built ground up from the bedrock-protocol package from PrismarineJS, mimicking and reusing what I can from PrismarineJS.

Please see https://github.com/PrismarineJS/mineflayer

### How to install and test

* git clone https://github.com/irkmandeer/slimfob.git
* cd slimfob
* npm run submodule
* npm install
* node bot.js
