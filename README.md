# Something like Mineflayer for Bedrock

A *very* experimental implementation for creating bedrock bots. Mostly for personal use, testing ideas, and learning about bedrock internal, learning some Nodejs. I'm just throwing this out there for possible inspiration.

Built ground up from the bedrock-protocol package from PrismarineJS, mimicking and reusing what I can from PrismarineJS.
